## Summary
(1) **Data Preprocessing**  
The data pre-processsing is done in the aux_functions.py, when called from the iris_prepare_AMF_inception.py. Also, the images are transformed in the dataset.py when called from the trainer scripts.  
(2)**Fine Tuning**  
Fine Tuning The models are loaded in the models.py in their respective init functions. The freeze member functions are responsible for freezing the layers.  
(3) **Training**  
Training The traning is done in respective scripts, iris_secure_Inception/iris_secure_attention for inception resnet and Vit models respectively.  
(3) **Results**  
Results The results are shown with the help of result_analysis.py, where it calls the required plotting functions from the aux_functions.py script.
